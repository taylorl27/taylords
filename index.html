    <p style="color: #cc184e">I am currently a third year at Northeastern with a major in Health Science, and a minor
      in Data Science. I am from Atlanta, Georgia and because of that it has been hard getting
      used to the harsh winters. My favorites things to do include reading, cooking, and hanging
      out with my friends. I also occasiaonly like to knit/crochet!
